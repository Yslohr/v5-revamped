This is not meant to start an argument. Credits to Iska for originally creating the mod I based myself of. Credits to all Former Ardium staff members players and donators, without you Ardium wouldn't have existed. Special Thanks to all mod developers who helped with this, I think particularly of the Mod Dev Cafe, Minecraft Mod Develoment and Minecraft Forge France discords for helping out with this.",
